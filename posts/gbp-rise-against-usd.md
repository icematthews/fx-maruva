## Improving risk appetite to drive Sterling higher

The Stochastic oscillator is showing that the GBP is heavily oversold against the USD. The pair could aim the nearest resistance at 1.3660-1.3690 while immediate support levels are between 1.3576-1.3610. The Elliot Wave pattern on the Daily timeframe is bullish. Further gains in US equities and US 10-Year Yields could push the pair higher.
