## Gains expected for AUD against USD

The Stochastic oscillator is showing that the AUD is heavily oversold against the USD. In what may seem like a contrarian trade, I have bought the pair at around 0.7294. Immediate support is expected between the 0.7264-0.7290 area and initial resistance is expected between 0.7321-0.7347. The Elliot Wave pattern on the Daily timeframe is bullish. I will look to further add to my position on downward retracements.

Prices of commodities such as Gold should drive the Aussie higher as widespread lockdowns around the world does not look likely, at least for now. Even if widespread lockdowns do happen, higher prices will return later. The vaccination rate in Australia is expected to accelerate in the near future as more vaccines are available, thus hopefully enabling the country to deal with rising Covid-19 cases. A pullback is expected for the USD after gaining impressively recently while the rebound in US equities is expected to push the pair higher.
