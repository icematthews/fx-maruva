## Euro set to gain against Japanese Yen

The Stochastic oscillator is showing that the EUR is heavily oversold against the JPY. Thus, I have bought the pair at around 128.70. Immediate support is expected between the 128.40 and 128.60 while the pair may target initial resistance between 129.47 and 129.69. The Elliot Wave pattern on the Daily timeframe is bullish. I will look to further add to my position on downward retracements. The EUR looks technically strong against GBP and USD while the JPY may decline against the USD. Fundamentally, the upcoming FOMC minutes may prove to be the catalyst for the pair to move higher.
