## British Pound to weaken against Aussie

The Stochastic oscillator is showing that the GBP is heavily overbought against the AUD. I have sold the pair at around 1.8981 and expect it to fall to the next level of support between 1.8893-1.8947. Initial resistance is between 1.9000-1.9014. The Elliot Wave pattern on the Daily timeframe is bearish. I will look to further add to my position on upward retracements. The USD looks technically strong against the GBP but may weaken against the AUD. Rising Gold prices, the FOMC Minutes and Australia's employment data release may be the catalyst for the pair to move lower.
