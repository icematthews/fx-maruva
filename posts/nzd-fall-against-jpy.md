## NZD to drop against Japanese Yen

The Stochastic oscillator is showing that the NZD is heavily overbought against the JPY. The pair is expected to fall towards the next support levels between 76.34 and 76.63 although it could first retrace towards immediate resistance around 77.35-77.64. The Elliot Wave pattern on the 4-Hour timeframe is bearish.

Rising Covid cases in Japan and technical bullishness of the JPY against the USD and AUD could plummet the pair lower.
