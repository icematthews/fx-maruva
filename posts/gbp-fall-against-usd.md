## Losses expected for Sterling against US Dollar

The bearish GBP theme looks set to continue as the Stochastic oscillator is showing that the GBP is heavily overbought against the USD. Nearby resistance at 1.3928-41 could provide the catalyst lower while immediate support levels are between 1.3872-84. The Elliot Wave pattern on the 4-Hour timeframe is bearish.

A higher US CPI print expected later today could send the USD higher as the Fed looks to taper asset purchases sooner rather than later.
