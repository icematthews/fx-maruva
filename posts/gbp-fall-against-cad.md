## Pound Sterling to fall against Canadian Dollar

The Stochastic oscillator is showing that the GBP is heavily overbought against the CAD. The pair is expected to fall towards the next support levels between 1.7275 and 1.7243 although it could first retrace towards immediate resistance around 1.7320 - 1.7360. The Elliot Wave pattern on the 1-Hour timeframe is bearish.

What could support the British Pound weakening theme is that the technical patterns for the GBP is bearish against the USD, JPY and EUR. Further gains in the US 10-Year Yields, the S&P 500 and Oil could also support the Canadian Dollar going forward.
