## Kiwi to weaken against Loonie

The Stochastic oscillator is showing that the NZD is heavily overbought against the CAD. The pair is expected to fall towards the next support levels between 1.8787 and 1.8798 although it could first retrace towards immediate resistance around 1.8837 - 1.8875. The Elliot Wave pattern on the Daily timeframe is bearish.

Canada has been one of the most vaccinated countries and its central bank has slowed its bond purchases at its last meeting due to its brightening economic growth outlook. The CAD has been oversold against the USD last month and a rebound is expected.
