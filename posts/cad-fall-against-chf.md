## Canadian Dollar to drop against Swiss Franc

The Stochastic oscillator is showing that the CAD is heavily overbought against the CHF. The pair is expected to fall towards the next support levels between 0.7247 and 0.7255 although it could first retrace towards immediate resistance around 0.7310-0.7320. The Elliot Wave pattern on the 4-Hour timeframe is bearish.

Oil could retrace downwards as the Covid Delta variant is proving to be a nuisance in the 3 major oil consuming countries (US, China & India). This could put pressure on the Canadian Dollar and spur the Swiss Franc.
