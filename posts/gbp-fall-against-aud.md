## Pound Sterling to fall against Aussie

The Stochastic oscillator is showing that the GBP is heavily overbought against the AUD. I have sold the pair at around 1.8744 and expect it to fall to the next level of support between 1.8654-1.8677. Initial resistance is between 1.8756-1.8820. The Elliot Wave pattern on the Daily timeframe is bearish. I will look to further add to my position on upward retracements.

Besides the already bright prospects of Gold and the expected increase in Australia's vaccination rate set to drive AUD higher, the country's Consumers Price Index(CPI) is forecasted to hit a 13-year high. On the other other hand, with US inflation still "transitory", the problems that the Covid-19 Delta variant could pose and US unemployment still high, the Fed is expected to maintain its current trajectory and send Gold prices higher.
