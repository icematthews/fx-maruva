## Euro forecasted to rise against Japanese Yen

The Stochastic oscillator is showing that the EUR is heavily oversold against the JPY. Thus, I have bought the pair at around the 130.00 handle. Immediate support is expected between the 129.58 and the 130.17 levels and initial resistance is expected between 130.17 and 130.43. The Elliot Wave pattern on the Daily timeframe is bullish. I will look to further add to my position on downward retracements.

Fundamentally, the ECB's recent adoption of an asymmetrical 2% inflation target over the medium term is considered bullish for the EUR and the BOJ's continuing of their easy monetary policy does support our trade.
