## Aussie to rise against Kiwi

The Stochastic oscillator is showing that the AUD is heavily oversold against the NZD. In what may seem like a contrarian trade, I have bought the pair at around the 1.06 handle. Immediate support is expected between the 1.0560-85 area and initial resistance is expected between 1.0635-48 The Elliot Wave pattern on the Daily timeframe is bullish. I will look to further add to my position on downward retracements.

Fundamentally, despite the resurgence in COVID-19 cases, the Australian economy is holding up pretty well with unemployment below 5% for the first time in 10 years. An improving market sentiment may also propel the Australian Dollar higher.
