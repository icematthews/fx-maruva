## Greenback to gain against Swiss Franc

The Stochastic oscillator is showing that the USD is heavily oversold against the CHF. The pair could aim the nearest resistance at 0.9132-0.9163 while immediate support levels are between 0.9074-0.9091. The Elliot Wave pattern on the 4-Hour timeframe is bullish. Good data from the US are continued to be expected starting with the Q2 GDP. Further good data will push the Fed to start the inevitable tapering process sending USD higher.
