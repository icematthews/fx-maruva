## USD to surge against Japanese Yen

The Stochastic oscillator is showing that the USD is heavily oversold against the JPY. The pair could aim the nearest resistance at 109.60-109.74 while immediate support levels are between 109.04-109.20. The Elliot Wave pattern on the Daily timeframe is bullish. A good jobs report this Friday could send the USD higher as Fed prepares market for taper.
